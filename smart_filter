Email providers look for a number of factors when deciding whether to automatically send your emails to spam. If you‚Äôve made it on an email blacklist, that means you‚Äôve repeatedly sent emails to recipients who haven‚Äôt signed up for your email list.
Email providers only want to deliver emails from high-reputation senders. To be a high-reputation sender, do the following:

If you meet these criteria, you can get away with using ‚Äúclassic‚Äù email spam words in your subject line and your email. The text surrounding the spam phrase also matters, as does your history as an email sender. If email providers don‚Äôt have a reason to mistrust you, they simply won‚Äôt.

Spam Trigger Words
Spam filters can be triggered for a variety of reasons, causing your email to skip recipients' inboxes and land straight in their spam inbox. One of the easiest ways to avoid spam filters is by carefully choosing the words you use in your email's subject line.
Spam trigger words alone aren‚Äôt enough to send your email to spam. For instance, if you are offering a 3-for-1 discount sale, you can still advertise that in your emails and not get sent to spam. It‚Äôs important to understand all the factors that come into play when emails get identified as spam.
Spam trigger words are phrases that email providers flag as fraudulent and malicious. When they identify these emails, they then route them away from recipients‚Äô inboxes. These words and phrases typically overpromise a positive outcome with the goal of getting sensitive information from the recipient.
